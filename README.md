<H1>Pokemon Safari</H1>

Pokemon Safari is an app that attempts to simulate the age old adage of "Gotta Catch 'Em All".  

Using data directly from the Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/), hunt for various pokemon across a multitude of environments while enjoying nostalgic tracks that have become fan-favorites among the series. When a pokemon appears on your screen, you can view information about it, catch it, and give it a nickname. 

Keep an eye out for shinies!
